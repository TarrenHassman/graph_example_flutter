# graph_example_flutter
a guage chart implementation written in flutter (using the flutter charts library)

Gallery of other charts available in flutter charts: https://google.github.io/charts/flutter/gallery.html

You will find the flutter specific files inside of the lib folder.

I have included a screenshot of the web build so that you do not need to install a flutter development enviroment to view the example.
